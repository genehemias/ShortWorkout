## Roadmap/Contributions
Planned features:  
- make it 'dark mode' (black background with white text)
- modularize/organize the javascript a bit better
- splash a banner when the cycle is complete
- add a counter that shows how many excercises are complete/total for the workout
- make the number of excercises configurable based on user input/setting
  - use a slider
  - within reason: minimum of 5, maximum of 25(?), default 7
  - display a dynamic workout length based on current number of excercises selected
    - multiply the number of excercises by the length of each excercise. add to that the multiple of the number of rests by the length of each rest
- add more excercises
- improve the excercise descriptions
- store the excercises elsewhere and fetch them via api/AJAX call on initial page load
- use browser's IndexedDB to track completed workouts
  - add a view where users can view workout history
  - a scrollable modal. support pagination?
